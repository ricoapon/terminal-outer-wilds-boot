NAME
    cd - Changes the current directory.

SYNOPSIS
    cd PATH

DESCRIPTION
    You are browsing through a file system. Using commands like `ls` you can see files inside your current directory.
    This command can be used to change to another directory.

    You don't need to change your directory step by step, you can give a full path to directly go to another directory.

OPTIONS
    PATH can be either absolute (starting with "/") or relative (not starting with "/").
    The command supports using '..' to refer to the parent directory.

EXAMPLES
    `cd step-2` can be used to move into the step-2 directory. You must currently be in the tutorial directory for this
    to work though.
    `cd /tutorial/step-2` can be used to directly go to the step-2 directory. It doesn't matter where you are.
    `cd ..` go back one directory.
    `cd ../..` go back two directories.
