NAME
    pwd - Shows the current directory you are in.

SYNOPSIS
    pwd [-P]

DESCRIPTION
    You are browsing through a file system. Each file has a unique path, which is denoted in a specific way. An example
    is `/some/path/to/file.txt`. Looking at this path, you can see that from the directory "some" you can go into the
    directory "path" and after that into "to". The "to" directory contains the file "file.txt".  Paths can also refer to
    a directory like this: "/path/to/directory".

    This pwd command shows your current location.

    Paths never end in a slash (if you do, the program will ignore the slash).

OPTIONS
    -P ignores symbolic links.
