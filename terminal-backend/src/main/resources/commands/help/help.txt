You have access, using this terminal, to the special server! There are all kinds of secrets...
Can you uncover all of them and find the exit?

CONTROLS
   The game works using a so-called terminal (the thing you see right in front of you with the
   purple background). You can type commands and press enter. Different commands do different
   things. For example, you just executed the help commands!

TRY YOUR FIRST COMMANDS
   The first command I will teach you is `ls`. It is short for "list". This command will list all the
   directories and files that you see in your current directory. Lines starting with "d" indicates
   directories and "f" means files.

   If you try this command right now, you can see there are files and directories here! One of the
   files is called "step-1.txt". You can read this file using the `read` command! Go ahead
   and type `read step-1.txt`.



FEEDBACK
   If you have any feedback about this game, don't hesitate to contact the creator! You can contact
   Rico Apon directly, or you can just create a new issue on the GitHub page:

FOR DEVELOPERS
   I am well aware that you can find all the secrets by using the browser Developer Tool or looking
   through the source code. I am not going to stop you, but if you do know that you lost a cool
   experience!
